            <h1>"You wake up to a wood and circular patterned roof that seems to be leaking something..." You: "h..HELLO?" No one answers. You get off off of your velvet bed. You see drawings on the walls of the room. They say, "SUREDC FINALE" and weird symbols like, "@(Nc82h2gfbn7g3b2(Ng". There are images of demons from greek mythology and other fictional demonic beings from all across the world, from different religions, to different cultures. "WAKE UP" Screams a omnipricent voice. "THE GAMES HAVE BEGUN!"</h1>

"5 KILLERS HAVE DASHED WITHIN YOUR HOUSE" "You will be given a chance to prevail the trial...if...you are worthy!" you:"..what kind of joke is this???" Voice in the background: "....."</h1>
